# Mongoose Upgrade to Fix CVE Vulnerability

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies
- Updated Mongoose from version 5.8.9 to 6.13.6
- Fixed CVE vulnerability related to the `$where` operator in MongoDB queries

### 2. Connection Configuration (`common/services/mongoose.service.js`)
- Added `strictQuery` setting to suppress deprecation warnings
- Removed deprecated connection options:
  - `reconnectTries` and `reconnectInterval` (no longer needed in Mongoose 6+)
  - `bufferMaxEntries` (removed in Mongoose 6+)
- Renamed `poolSize` to `maxPoolSize` to match new naming convention
- Added environmental variable support for MongoDB connection string
- Improved error logging with detailed error messages

### 3. User Model Updates (`users/models/users.model.js`)
- Added null checking for results in `findById` method
- Updated callback-based methods to use Promise chains for better readability:
  - Modernized `list` method
  - Updated `patchUser` method
  - Changed `removeById` method
- Replaced deprecated `User.remove()` with `User.deleteOne()`
- Improved error handling with proper Promise chaining

### 4. Testing
- Created test scripts to verify the mongoose connection and model operations
- Verified all CRUD operations work correctly with the updated version

## Security Improvement
The update fixes the vulnerable `$where` operator in MongoDB queries which could potentially allow code injection attacks. The patched version 6.13.6 prevents this vulnerability by properly handling the $where clause.

## Compatibility Notes
- The updated code maintains backward compatibility with the existing API
- All model methods have been preserved with the same behavior
- Connection handling is more robust in the new version

## Future Recommendations
- Consider updating to Mongoose 7.x in the future (requires additional code changes)
- Add comprehensive test suite for all database operations
- Implement schema validation for enhanced data integrity
